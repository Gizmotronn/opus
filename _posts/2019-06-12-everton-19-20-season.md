Everton's 2019-20 season will hopefully be a good one. Under Marco Silva last season (18-19), we finished 8th. I'm going to preview our season in this post.

# Everton's new stadium:

Architect Dan Meis is in charge of the design and the first public consultation received overwhelming support from the people of Liverpool. A PDF document containing the leaked images of the reported new site were obtained by supporter’s website Everton Aren’t We, who posted the pictures on Friday.
