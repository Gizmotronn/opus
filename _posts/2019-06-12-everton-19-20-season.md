Architect Dan Meis is in charge of the design and the first public consultation received overwhelming support from the people of Liverpool. A PDF document containing the leaked images of the reported new site were obtained by supporter’s website Everton Aren’t We, who posted the pictures on Friday. The new move is unlikely to take place until 2023, with proposals for 12,000-15,000 safe standing seats in the south stand. Goodison Park has been the home of Everton since 1892 and the plans offer a side-by-side comparison of the current ground.
