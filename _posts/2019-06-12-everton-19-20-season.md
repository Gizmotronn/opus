Everton's 2019-20 season will hopefully be a good one. Under Marco Silva last season (18-19), we finished 8th. I'm going to preview our season in this post.

# 2018-19 Review
* Leading goalkicker: Richarlison de Andrae (#30) & Glyfi Sigurdsson (#10) - 14 goals all competitions
* Fan's player of the year: Lucas Digne (#12)

Last season, Everton won 15 games, drew 9, and lost 14, compared to 13 wins, 10 draws, and 15 losses in the 2017-18 season. We finished with 6 wins and 3 draws in our last 11 matches, losing to lowly Fulham (who were already relegated) 2-0 away and Newcastle 3-2 (after being up by 2 goals. Newcastle's third goal was controversial, however the result stood). Against Tottenham Hotspurs in Match Day 38, we drew 2-2. If we had of held on against Newcastle, and we hadn't of underestimated Fulham, we could have won 7 of our last 11, a result nobody would have thought possible given our dreary festive period (I think a draw was the best result we could've managed against the Spurs). We could have qualified for the Europa League 2019-20 season.

Apart from those minor blips, we were flying in the last rounds of the season - 4-0 against Man United, 1-0 against Arsenal, and 2-0 against Chelsea being some big highlights. We even kept Liverpool to a 0-0 draw at the derby at Goodison, which meant that Liverpool didn't win the league title. Richarlison & Sigurdsson continued their stellar season, both players slotting 13 goals in the premier league. For a club that finished 8th on the table, to have 2 players kick 28 goals in all competitions between them is really good. Dominic Calvert-Lewin (#29) kicked a few as well and definitely came of age last season.

It was really hard watching Everton in the festive period. Apart from a 5-1 win against Burnley on Boxing Day (I was in New York at the time and streamed the match at a cafe) and a 2-0 win against Bournemouth, we played horribly, losing to Brighton and to Leicester City. We hovered around 11-12th during the festive season, and many supporters on Facebook talked about how we were going backwards. It definitely looked like it.

We have finished 8th in the last 2 seasons. Overall, that looks like no improvement. But our win-loss record improved, and our goal-scoring abilities improved as well (however, as good as Richarlison has been, I wouldn't have paid the 50 million we apparently did just for him. 35 million was definitely a better deal. I may be eating my words at the end of next season, but Richarlison was not worth 50 million last season). 

We scored heavily in those last few games:

* 2-0 against West Ham (away)
* 3-0 against Cardiff City (home)
* 4-0 against Man Utd (home)
* 2-0 against Chelsea (home)
* 1-0 against Arsenal (home)
* 2-3 against Newcastle (home)
* 2-2 against Spurs (away)
* 2-0 against Burnley (home)

We kicked 14 goals in 6 games at home at the end of the season. We turned Goodison Park into a fortress. If we can do that again next season, as well as score more heavily away, we will finish higher. To lose to Fulham and draw against Palace was disappointing - 2 teams that were at the lower end of the table. 

Overall, I think we took great steps in the 2018-19 season. But more has to be done.

# Everton's new stadium:

Architect Dan Meis is in charge of the design and the first public consultation received overwhelming support from the people of Liverpool. A PDF document containing the leaked images of the reported new site were obtained by supporter’s website Everton Aren’t We, who posted the pictures on Friday.
