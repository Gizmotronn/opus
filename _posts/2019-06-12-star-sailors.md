Fremantle. The port of Western Australia. And until recently, a place I visited at least once a month (on the weekends) with my family. Whether it was for Pancakes at the Chalky’s cafe in the morning, or a set of Spanish Donuts at San Churros, Fremantle was a time to walk and talk with the family (and recently, the dog, Elsie, who we insist on bringing with us for walks).

It was way, way back in 2017. I was in year 9 at the time, and I was part of the junior writing club. I was walking along Fremantle with my dad, and we were talking about what sorts of sport could be played in space. We came up with something called Space Ball, which I’ll talk about in a [future post](https://acord-robotics.github.io/starsailors/hydejack/2019-03-16-space-ball/). That gave me the idea to write another science fiction story set in space.

### Orlando, Florida - Revisiting Star Sailors
On the 23rd of December, 2018 (funnily enough, it was the 3rd ACORD Birthday) I touched down in New York at the JFK International airport. On the 2nd of January (2019), I touched down in Orlando. We spent 3 days at Universal Studios and my mum and I went to Disneyworld.

When my dad and I were having dinner at the hotel one night, I raised the topic of the book again, since he’d given me a few ideas originally. We came up with a cross-between of soccer and handball with jetpacks. This is all subject to change, so keep an eye out for the post about space ball which is coming out soon.
