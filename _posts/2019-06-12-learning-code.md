I've created websites with Wordpress, Drupal, and Wix since 2016, however at the end of last year I decided that I wanted to go into robotics and game design. To do this, I decided to learn some more coding languages. I'm currently going through some courses on C++ and at school I'm learning C#. I hope to share my progress on this site.

# Sololearn
Sololearn is a free-to-use site that hosts coding tutorials on many languages, including:

* C
* C++
* C#
* HTML
* CSS
* Ruby
* Python
* Java
* Javascript
* PHP
* Swift (4)
* jQuery
* SQL

Thanks to Sololearn, I've learnt HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Java & Javascript. I've now turned my attention to C++ & C#, as they will be the languages I'll be using for the assessments at school.

I host my notes and practice code on [My Sololearn Profile](https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/5134550), as well as on [Gitlab - CPP Tutorial](https://gitlab.com/IrisDroidology/cpp-tutorial-vLnPwxZdW4Y). 

Currently I've learnt about:

* [Basic Concepts](https://gitlab.com/IrisDroidology/cpp-tutorial-vLnPwxZdW4Y/blob/master/sololearn/basic-concepts.md) --- How C++ works and how you write code using it
* [Conditionals & Loops](https://gitlab.com/IrisDroidology/cpp-tutorial-vLnPwxZdW4Y/blob/master/sololearn/conditionals-and-loops.md) --- How to create loops and control structures

## Example code structures
In my notes, I've listed some example syntax for different things:

Relational Operators:
```c++
if (7 > 4) {
  cout <<  "Yes"; 
}

// Outputs "Yes"
```
