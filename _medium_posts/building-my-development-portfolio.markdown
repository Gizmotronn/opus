I've created websites with Wordpress, Drupal, and Wix since 2016, however at the end of last year I decided that I wanted to go into robotics and game design. To do this, I decided to learn some more coding languages. I'm currently going through some courses on C++ and at school I'm learning C#. I hope to share my progress on this site.
Sololearn
Sololearn is a free-to-use site that hosts coding tutorials on many languages, including:
C
C++
C#
HTML
CSS
Ruby
Python
Java
Javascript
PHP
Swift (4)
jQuery
SQL

Thanks to Sololearn, I've learnt HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Java & Javascript. I've now turned my attention to C++ & C#, as they will be the languages I'll be using for the assessments at school.
I host my notes and practice code on My Sololearn Profile.
Currently I've learnt about:
Basic Concepts - How C++ works and how you write code using it
Conditionals & Loops- How to create loops and control structures

Example code structures
In my notes, I've listed some example syntax for different things:



Other languages I know
I have experience in Python, especially in creating text-based games (for example Pythons of Mars). I hope to expand my knowledge of Python after completing C++ & C#.
Thanks for reading

ACORD, my robotics company, is a not-for-profit and we're currently working on a robot to reduce suicide levels in teenagers with disabilities. Why not support us? Check out our patreon.
I'm a high school student and I'm about to go into university. I build websites for a living, and why not get one from me? It will at least help me when I'm at uni - support me.
And finally, thanks so much for reading this post. The best way to get quality content like this shared is for you to share it, so why not post this on facebook and twitter!
